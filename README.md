Part_1:
All scripts, graphs and analysis can be found in part_1/Zhentao_exercise_part_1.ipynb
You can open it in jupyter notebbok and rerun all script

Part_2:
Have implemented both CBArray class and CBArrayEasyMin class to pass all unittests.
Made a small modification on test_case_48 in test_cb_array.py since I think there should be a typo error.

Thanks for designing those questions. I enjoyed a lot working on them. Look forward to hearing from you!
